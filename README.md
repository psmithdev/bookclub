Let's become better programmers!

Join us in the * * * Lobby * * * voice channel of our Discord server

We are hosting a bi-weekly book club to have open discussions about computer programming, personal and career development, software design/architecture and more!

We have already chosen our first book, The Pragmatic Programmer, and moving forward, we'll have a vote of which book to read once a month.

ISBN: 0135957052

During our virtual book club, we'll digest the chapters in our discussions, explore new ideas and how to implement these concepts in our everyday lives, ask questions, share knowledge and more!

Tip 1: Care about Your Craft<br>
Care about developing software and do it well.  Tell others what you are doing!  Family, close friends, let them know what you spend your time on and enjoy doing.

Tip 2: Think! about your work<br>
IBM old corporate motto, never be on auto-pilot.  Constantly be thinking and critiquing your work.

Tip 3: It's your life<br>
It is your life.  You own it.  You run it.  You create it.
